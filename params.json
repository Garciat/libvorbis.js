It also includes a library wrapper\r\nthat implements the W3C [`MediaRecorder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder)\r\ninterface**.\r\n\r\nUltimately, **libvorbis.js** allows you to *encode PCM data to Ogg Vorbis in the browser*.\r\n**Ogg Vorbis** is a free and open-source codec for lossy audio compression.\r\n\r\n**libvorbis.js** is 216KB big (minified, gzipped) and runs about 3x slower in V8, compared to native. (2.5x in Firefox).\r\n\r\n** Full compliance under development.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nYes, Firefox already supports the `MediaRecorder` API, which renders this library useless.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Chromium (Chrome) does not yet ship a public, audio-capable\r\nimplementation of `MediaRecorder`. (It should arrive with Chromium 49.)\r\n\r\n**libvorbis.js** aims to fill this void for the time being.\r\n\r\nBesides this, encoding audio in the browser is beneficial in the following ways:\r\n\r\n* Reduces server load; all the hard work is done in the client's browser\r\n\r\n* Reduces browser storage usage ([IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) / [Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API))\r\n\r\n* Reduces upload time and data transfer; encoded audio files are a fraction of the size of raw WAV files\r\n\r\n## OK, cool. What now?\r\n\r\n## Demo it.\r\n\r\n[Bare bones recorder](https://libvorbis-js.surge.sh/)\r\n\r\n[Voice Memos fork](https://voice-memos-vorbis.surge.sh/) (original by: [Paul Lewis](https://aerotwist.com/blog/voice-memos/))\r\n\r\n## Install it.\r\n\r\nYou can use **bower** to install **libvorbis.js** as a dependency:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbower install libvorbis.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Download it.\r\n\r\n[Download](https://github.com/Garciat/libvorbis.js-bower/releases/latest) from the bower distribution repo.\r\n\r\n## Build it.\r\n\r\n**Requirements**\r\n\r\n- emscripten compiler\r\n- node.js & npm\r\n\r\n**Preparations**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install --dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat should install (locally):\r\n\r\n- TypeScript 1.8+ compiler\r\n- TypeScript Definition Manager\r\n- UglifyJS\r\n\r\n**Instructions**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit submodule init\r\ngit submodule update\r\nmake -j\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, look for `build/libvorbis.js` or `build/libvorbis.min.js`.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n - [Alex Barkan](http://hotcashew.com/2014/02/chrome-audio-api-and-ogg-vorbis/)\r\n - [Devon Govett](https://github.com/devongovett/ogg.js)\r\n - [Salehen Shovon Rahman](https://github.com/shovon/libvorbis.js)\r\n - [Jose Sullivan](https://github.com/itsjoesullivan/libvorbis.js)\r\n\r\n## Ogg License (BSD)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2002, Xiph.org Foundation\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\r\nare met:\r\n\r\n- Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\r\nnotice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n\r\n- Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\r\nnotice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\r\ndocumentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\n- Neither the name of the Xiph.org Foundation nor the names of its\r\ncontributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\r\nthis software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\r\n``AS IS'' AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\r\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\r\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
